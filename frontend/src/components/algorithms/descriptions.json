  "1": "Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from an unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.",
  "2": "Bubble Sort repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements in a list, pushing the largest numbers to the end with each pass. It continues until the entire list is sorted.",
